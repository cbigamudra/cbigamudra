## Welcome 👋

My name is Charu Bigamudra. I am a CS student at Georgia State University. Whether I am designing a 3D component in Onshape or architecting a cloud solution on AWS, I believe in the principle of "Form Following Function." My background in 2D and 3D CAD taught me precision; my studies in Computer Science taught me scalability. I aim to build software that isn't just functional, but resilient and intuitive.
